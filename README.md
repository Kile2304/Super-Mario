# Super Mario
```
```
Replica of the famous game ### Super Mario
```
executed in java for pc, with included map editor and sprite creator.

contains a layer designer, which needs to be fixed and improved,
and an animator extractor to implement them on the game,
which currently does not work from jar fil

It supports controllers for the ps4, but is still in beta, 
so it has many bugs or it will be disabled, but the keyboard version works properly.

All the images in the program have not been made by me, but have 
been downloaded from the network, then I will put in a copyright.

Program not yet complete
